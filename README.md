# Word Gen

This is a stupid little application that generates words by concatenating 2 sinlge(ish) syllable words together.
I wanted to try and use this generate company name ideas.

Just call the main app and 100 words will be generated.

The original list of words was taken from the following
>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/monosyl.zip 
>>Lawler/Rhodes Simplex Word Database
which contains over 5000 English monosyllables and near-monosyllables.
It is placed in the public domain and available on the Web in ZIPfile
format.
